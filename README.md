# SnakeGame using Python #MiniProject2
Simulation of the ever young Snake Game using Python 
## Description

Snake Game simulation using Pygame. The project is modulated under 3 files which hold the code for initializing the pygame environment, making a snake object and making a food object repectively.


## Dependencies
* Sublime text Editor v3.2.2 Build 3211

* Terminal MacOS Catalina v10.15.1

* Python Libraries 
  - pygame
  - math 
  - random
  - time 
  

## Code Execution:
The code executes in 5 steps:
* Initializing pygame environment with init and assigning screen resolution, colors, frames rates per second elapsed, scaler variable and a loop for running the events in pygame.
* Initializing functions for displaying message and score on the screen in SnakeGame.py
* Initilizing Snake and Food class for holding functions for creating snake blocks on the corresponding x and y cordinates of the grid, checking boundarie conditions, assigning directions to the snake and checking for self collision in the Snake class whereas creating food block and checking for if the snake eats the food in the Food class.
* Assigning key press functionalities under the event running loop for closing and restarting the game on game over and incrementing the x and y cordinates for the snake block over arrow keys press.
* Finally calling all the appropriate functions from the provided Snake and Food files and displayig the score.
